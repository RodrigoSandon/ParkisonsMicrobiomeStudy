# Purpose

This will be a step-by-step guide to our study to identify causal variants associated to bacterial genera that may have some effect on Parkinson's disease risk. In this case, we'll be using summary statistics of gut bacterial genera and of PD cases vs. controls (Nalls et. al 2019) and we'll be assuming usage of IPDGC, UKBB, and AMP-PD datasets for individual data (because of restrictions, we'll use dummy data).
